# Data-Visualisation

Data visualisation is a powerful tool for getting the most out of data by sharing it in a user-friendly and efficient way that highlights trends and variations. Through visualization, large amounts of information can be made easily understandable for users. 

This work is part of the Infovis module I had in first semester. We were asked to make a "Multiple Line chart" visualisation using d3js framework and apply some interactions to it.
Our work respect also Van shneiderman mantras since it provides an overview of the distrubtion, zomm and filter and details on demand.

Realized with my binome : AIN GUERAD Manel
